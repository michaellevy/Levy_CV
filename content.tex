\section{Research Experience}\label{research-experience}

\textbf{Mental Models of Sustainable Agriculture} UC Davis \& UC ANR,
2015 -\\
Participatory workshops around California to elicit experts' causal
models of sustainable agriculture. Analysis examines variance in model
structure and content across geography, experience, and profession.
Implications of policy proposals are simulated via consensus model as
transition matrix.

~

\textbf{Inference from Statistical Models of Networks} UC Davis, 2015
-\\
Analytical and computational evidence for proper interpretation of
estimates on geometrically weighted statistics of exponential random
graph models.

~

\textbf{Dynamics of Fire, Vegetation, and Human Behavior} SESYNC, 2014
-\\
Coupled agent-based model of homeowner adoption of fire-defensive
behavior and landscape-scale fire and vegetation dynamics in
wildland-urban interface of the Cleavland National Forest in Southern
California. Deliniate trajectories of fire dynamics for various climate
scenarios and management interventions.

~

\textbf{Farmer Learning Networks, Cooperation, and Environmental
Management} UC Davis, 2013 -\\
Information networks of winegrowers contain abundant structures that are
adaptive to solve cooperation dilemmas. Growers use social ties to seek
innovation and to build trust for environmental management. Adoption of
some sustainability certifications is facilitated by social processes
while others are economically driven.

~

\textbf{Ecosystem Recovery After Surface Mining} West Virginia
University, 2010 - 2012\\
Some aspects of ecosystem structure recover rapidly after reclamation;
however, plant and fungal communities remain severely altered in the
medium term.
