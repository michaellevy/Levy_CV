# Teaching statement

## Teaching philosophy

Teaching is a performance art, and my first priority is holding my students' attention. Enthusiasm goes a long way, and I bring the joy and satisfaction that computing and statistics bring me into the classroom. Also critical is showing students the payoff of what they are learning, early and often. This motivates struggling through challenging details, which is especially important for detail-heavy methods courses. Even better than showing students the payoff is giving them an experiential taste of it. 
\medskip

I start my introduction to scientific computing classes with advanced visualization -- within the first class session students are creating beautiful, informative plots. Of course, they don't understand the details of the code that generated the plots, but they can play with it, and this connection to the material sustains motivation to wrestle with details in the weeks to come. 
\medskip

I subscribe to the philosophy of student-centered learning and the strategy of backward course design. This means that I start planning a course by defining the students' learning objectives in the context of their degree program; then I design summative assessments, completing which demonstrates meeting the objectives; and lastly I design lectures, activities, and formative assessments to get students to the point where they can complete the summative assessments and so reach the course objectives. I structure a lot of interactivity in the classroom, both among students and between myself and students, and I also ask for regular feedback, for example, using a quick Google Form to have students rate their understanding of a week's material, which I might quickly plot and show the students. This interaction helps keep me and the students aware of how well everyone is doing. That gives the students a better sense of how they might need to adjust their effort or when it would be beneficial to others to interrupt the class to ask a question, and it allows me to adjust my pace and methods to student needs. 
\medskip

I build flexibility into my methods courses by writing code in front of the class in every lecture. This might seem like an odd approach, but it has significant advantages and has worked very well for myself and others. It provides integrated flexibility; it forces slower delivery which tends to align well with the rate at which students absorb information; it shows the process of doing scientific computing rather than just the product; it demonstrates that I make mistakes and how I diagnose and fix them; and it allows me to demonstrate how I use the computer to figure out tough concepts. I generally deliver the code I write to students in real-time through a web link so that they can try to code along with me but can catch up by referencing my code if they miss something. They can then switch seamlessly from following along with my code to writing their own code during in-class exercises, which I use extensively.

## Teaching experience

I have taught a wide variety of subjects across all student levels. During my doctoral studies, I served as a Teaching Assistant for a PhD-level Bayesian statistics class for which the professor was out of the country for the duration of course (lectures were pre-recorded and I was the primary contact for the XX students). As part of my Professors for the Future Fellowship, I developed a one-week, 30-classroom-hour intensive introduction to the statistical programming language `R`. The course was made available to graduate students and post-docs at UC Davis, over 350 of whom registered. I delivered the class to 200 students, and it was widely well reviewed (Mean student evaluations: instructor's overall teaching: 4.6/5, inspired and motivated student interest: 4.7/5, demonstrated concern for student learning: 4.9/5). I also TA-ed for the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) during the summers of my PhD program.
\medskip

During my master's, I taught a capstone Biology course in which groups of undergraduates executed a research project from conceptualization and proposal to analysis and presentation in a semester, and I TA-ed introductory and environmental biology courses. I TA-ed chemistry laboratories as an undergraduate, and between my undergraduate and graduate programs, I taught English in South Korea and Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) preparation for the Princeton Review. 

I have also mentored many student research projects. In addition to the above-mentioned research class, I mentored an undergraduate's honor's thesis on the effects of coal ash application to surface mines during my master's. I also incorporated an undergraduate into my doctoral research and mentored high school students' research projects through the EnviroMentors program. 

## Teaching interests

I am primarily interested in teaching applied methodology courses at a variety of levels. I enjoy showing students how a computational or statistical technique can provide insight into a substantive question of interest. I can teach undergraduate and graduate statistics and can incorporate computation into those classes in such a way that builds that skill as well as bolstering statistical understanding. I would love to teach advanced classes in network analysis and agent-based modeling. I could also teach computing classes largely separate statistics, covering topics such as version control, data and code management, and automation through shell scripting. Substantively, I am qualified to teach classes on individual decision making, policy analysis, and social-ecological systems.
